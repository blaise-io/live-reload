# Live Reload (work in progress)

**Firefox addon for web developers. Reload a browser tab when source files are updated.**

This addon allows web developers to configure included source files to
monitor on a page. Whenever one of the monitored files is changed, the
browser tab gets refreshed.

Currently only scripts and stylesheets are supported for monitoring.


## To do for MVP

 - Toolbar button
 - Click button -> open configuration dialog
 - Allow global enable/disable
 - Allow modifying reload rules and monitored files
 - Indication which files are being monitored
