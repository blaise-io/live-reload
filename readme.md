# Live Reload (work in progress)

**Firefox addon for web developers. Reload a browser tab when source files are updated.**

This addon allows web developers to configure included source files to
monitor on a page. Whenever one of the monitored files is changed, the
browser tab gets refreshed.

Currently only scripts and stylesheets are supported for monitoring.


## Features under consideration

 - Indication which files are being monitored
 - Indication why a page got refreshed
 - Create reload-in-place option that allows reloading only the
   changed source file instead of entire page
 - Option to sync rules across devices
